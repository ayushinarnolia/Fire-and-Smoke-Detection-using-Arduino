# üî• Arduino-Based Smart Fire and Smoke Detection with AI Integration

This project presents an intelligent fire and smoke detection system using **Arduino Uno**, combining traditional sensors with **AI-based anomaly detection** for enhanced safety. The system delivers real-time alerts via a **buzzer**, **LCD display**, **voice output**, and **Telegram messages**, while also providing **live graphing** of sensor data.

## üìë Abstract

An AI-enhanced fire and smoke detection system is developed using Arduino Uno with an MQ-2 smoke sensor, flame sensor, and a 16√ó2 LCD. Sensor data is analyzed in real time using an **Isolation Forest model** in Python. Upon detecting fire or smoke, the system triggers a buzzer, displays alerts, sends voice announcements, and delivers Telegram notifications. The hybrid approach significantly reduces false alarms and improves response time compared to traditional threshold-only systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- MQ-2 Gas/Smoke Sensor
- Flame Sensor
- 16√ó2 I2C LCD Display
- Buzzer
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- USB Cable (for power & data)

## üíª Software and Tools

- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- Python (PySerial, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pyttsx3, python-telegram-bot, Asyncio)
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Telegram Bot for remote alerts

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Arduino reads values from the MQ-2 and flame sensors.
2. Basic threshold check triggers buzzer + LCD alert.
3. Sensor data is sent via serial to Python.
4. Python's Isolation Forest model checks for anomalies.
5. On anomaly/fire detection:
   - Voice alert is announced.
   - Telegram alert is sent.
   - Live graph is updated with Matplotlib.
